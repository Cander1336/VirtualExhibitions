Execution command arguments:
-gui -agents profiler:ProfilerAgent;guide:TourGuideAgent;curator:CuratorAgent;searcher:ServiceSearchAgent

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
On startup up the ProfilerAgents randomly generate a profile from database (Profiles.txt). The Curator (only support for 1 agent in system for the moment) randomly loads in a artifact database.
ProfilerAgents continuously spawns tours by requesting it from a TourGuideAgent by asking for some artifacts that matchs the profile's interests.
TourGuideAgent get these artifact IDs from CuratorAgent and send them back to ProfilerAgent. Then ProfilerAgent ask CuratorAgent for description and details about the artifacts by
sending the IDS over in a request. Profiler prints the virtual exhibition in console.
ServiceSerachAgent was very simply implemented to test and learn how to use DF-functions without having much relation to program scenario.
