Execution command arguments:
-gui -platform-id VE -agents profiler:ProfilerAgent;guide:TourGuideAgent;curator1:CuratorAgent;curator2:CuratorAgent;curator3:CuratorAgent;auctioneer:Auctioneer
(it's convenient to run the program for about 10-20 seconds, terminate it, and then study the output)

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
An auctioneer agent have a stock of artifacts and is holding a ongoing auction process until there are no more artifacts. Multiple curator agents are participating in the auction.
The curators have different interests (matching with artifacts genre tags) & priority among his/her interests(priority 1-5 possible) when bidding on items,
also a budget to take into consideration (never spend more than 70% of his/her money balance). 
These two parameters are initiated randomly thus making the auction realistic and unique
although the bidding strategy is pretty simple. A curator is willing to pay more for those items of higher priority for him/her, and nothing at all for items that doesn't interest him/her at all.
The auction processes and the outcome is printed in console. 
The VirtualExhibition process (from HW1) is retained and running the background, but the related console output is masked out to focus on the additions of HW2
